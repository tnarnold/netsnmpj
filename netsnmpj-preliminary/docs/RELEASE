netsnmpj-0.2.1

   All MIB functions have been moved to libnetsnmpj.so library.
   Use of libnetsnmpjmib.so is now deprecated.

   Fix for AgentX support where registering more than one or two agent
was failing.  

   Fix that allows an AgentX object to handle an entire tree instead of
a single instance.


netsnmpj-0.2.0

   Support for sending V1 and V2 traps.  

   Support for creating AgentX sub-agents.

   The library and accompanying tools now support SNMPv3 transactions.  

   The netsnmpj library is now thread-safe.  Transactions can be
performed across multiple threads.

   The library classes NetSNMPSession, DefaultOID, InstanceOID, and
PDU are serializable.

   The NetSNMPSession.read() method is deprecated.  All SNMP
transactions are now performed by a separate thread.  Included with
this is a 'NetSNMPSyncSession' class that can perform SNMP
transactions synchronously.

   The Solaris build is built with the Sun CC compiler instead of g++.
This eliminates the need for the libstdc++ library that comes with the
gcc distribution.

   A Warnings class has been added that provides diagnostics for
missing libraries.

   Improvements to internal exception handling.  

   The swing snmpget tool now performs the 'walk' operation as well.

   The swingui package contains useful components for mib browsing and
session configuration.

   Thanks to the contribution from the NetSNMP
group(http://www.net-snmp.org) for the collection of mibs included
with the distribution.  These mibs are supplied for systems, such as
win32 where netsnmp may not have been installed.  They are the same
mibs as those found in the net-snmp 5.0.8.  


KNOWN ISSUES:

   When a program is using the AgentX features, it cannot perform SNMP
queries to to other agents.

   AgentX support is not available on Windows systems, yet.  It is
being worked on.
