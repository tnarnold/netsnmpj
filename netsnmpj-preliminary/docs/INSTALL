unzip the archive

There should be the following components

netsnmpj-RELEASE/netsnmpj.jar
netsnmpj-RELEASE/SYSTEM/libnetsnmpj.so
netsnmpj-RELEASE/SYSTEM/libnetsnmpjmib.so

To run any of the programs within netsnmp.jar

cd netsnmpj-0.2.0

java -Djava.library.path=SYSTEM -cp netsnmpj.jar org.netsnmp.swingui.snmpget
java -Djava.library.path=SYSTEM -cp netsnmpj.jar org.netsnmp.examples.GetSysDescr <host> <community>
java -Djava.library.path=SYSTEM -cp netsnmpj.jar org.netsnmp.examples. <host> <community>

Where SYSTEM is currently one of:  Win32-x86 linux-i386 or solaris-sparc

The script file snmpget.sh will launch the swing snmpget application
from the archive directory:

cd netsnmpj-0.2.0
./snmpget.sh

On Win32 platforms:

.\snmpget.bat


Installing as an extension in your existing JRE(Java Runtime Environment)


Copy the jar file to JAVAHOME/jre/lib/ext
And the .so libraries to JAVAHOME/jre/lib/SYSTEM

Your platform should have the net-snmp 5.0.6 or above package
installed.  If not installed alread, it is available from

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12694

For win32 systems, the net-snmp libraries have been statically linked
into the netsnmpj.dll and netsnmpjmib.dll libraries, so a full
installation of net-snmp on Windows is not necessary.  You may however
need the MIB files that come with the netsnmp-5.0.x distribution.
These files are found in netsnmp-5.0.x/mibs.  They have been included
in this distribution.  They may be copied to a location on your
windows systems.  Set the environmental variable MIBDIRS to this
location: For example:

set MIBDIRS=c:\net-snmp-5.0.7\mibs

Additional directories may be specified by separating them with
semi-colons.
