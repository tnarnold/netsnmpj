   netsnmpj is an open source Java library that allows java code to
perform SNMP v1, v2c, and V3 operations using the net-snmp library.
It is composed of both java and native code elements.  Please read the
INSTALL file for details on installation.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

The java portions are compatible with java 1.3.1 and above.  Currently
Linux, Solaris 2.8 and MS-Windows(NT/2k/XP) are the only platforms
currently built.  However, it should build readily enough on others.
Unix systems should have net-snmp-5.0.6 or higher installed.  

SOURCE CODE

Source code is available from
http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=73136

DEMO

For Linux and Solaris platforms, the snmpget.sh script will launch a
version of 'snmpget' with a Java Swing user interface.  Queries are
made through the NetSNMPSession, OID and PDU objects.  The application
also contains a built-in MIB browser.  The snmpget.bat is the win32
version of this launching script
